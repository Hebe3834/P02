    - Collaborated on making changes to the design doc for our project
    - Changes:
        - Fixed template for the profile page 
        - Deleted "/create" since it was the same as "/register"
        - Elaborated on moving obstacles in JS
        - Added item type to the stored database
        - Elaborated on background images so that it is clear that the character and obstacles won't blend into the background

    - Worked on integrating previous login and register code during class

    - Worked on basic js animation

    - Basic generating and moving rectangular obstacles (now the program infinitely generates rectangles with different lengths and moves them towards where the character will be standing). However, no guarantee that the rectangles would be reachable.

    - Created the items owned database during class

roshaniS -- 2022-03-08 20:26
    - Added a function to database.py that adds entries to the items owned database

justinZ -- 2022-03-09 09:23
    - Finished up login and register, starting work on database

roshaniS -- 2022-03-09 09:39
    - Worked on store.html
    - Added sprites and some functions for animations (crouch and run)
    
hebeH -- 2022-03-10 05:33
    - Fixed problem of infinitely adding obstacles to array. Tried to make sprites show up

yuqingW -- 2022-03-09 09:45
    - Worked on making the rectangles looking like the dinosaur game. Make the rectangles jumpable and with variable height and distance. 
    
yuqingW, roshaniS -- 2022-03-10 09:37
    - Fixed sprites animation, adding on pressing arrow down to make character crouch. 

yuqingW -- 2022-03-10 10:28
    - The character is now able to jump and the jump will auto fall due to gravity.
